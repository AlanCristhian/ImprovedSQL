# Sublime Text 2 SQL.tmLanguage
This is a modified version of the SQL language file for Sublime Text 2.

I'm constantly updating this file to add missing functions, operators etc when I stumble across them. One day, I'll difference the changes between the original and mine and start listing them here, in the mean time, just know that this file has a few more functions.

I do not own this file. I've just taken an already open source file and made my own changes.
